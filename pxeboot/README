# kiwi provide a default structure for the pxe boot environment
# with the package kiwi-pxeboot. The package additionally provides
# the boot configuration which requires the package kiwi-pxeboot-prebuild
# to be installed.
#
# The configuration for booting over PXE is stored in
# /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default. This means if there is already
# a prebuild boot image for the operating system version you want to
# create a system image for the only action you need to take care for
# is creating the system image and system image configuration according
# to your needs
#
# NOTE:
# the prebuild boot images can't be created from within openSUSE
# according to this the kiwi-pxeboot-prebuild contains a README.prebuild
# file which explains it
#
