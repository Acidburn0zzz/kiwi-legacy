# kiwi provide a default structure for the pxe boot environment
# with the package kiwi-pxeboot. The package additionally provides
# a specific set of prebuild boot images and the boot configuration
# in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default. This means if there is already
# a prebuild boot image for the operating system version you want to
# create a system image for the only action you need to take care for
# is creating the system image and system image configuration according
# to your needs
