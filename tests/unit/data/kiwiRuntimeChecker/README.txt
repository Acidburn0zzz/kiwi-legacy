At present (02/24/2011) it is not possible to create a KIWIXML object by
passing an XML file name. Thus for testing purposes when an XML file is
required we need to create a separate directory containing a config.xml file.

Once the KIWIXML objects ctor has been changed, XML files can be collected in
one directory with more meaningful names.
