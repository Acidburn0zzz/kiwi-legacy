\section{What is a live CD}
Normally an image will be installed on a disk or into the
main memory of a computer. This is done by a deployment
architecture which transfers the image via a boot image
into its final destination. such a boot image can also
exist on a CD. The task of the CD-Boot image is to setup
a system which is divided into two parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Read-Only part which is obtained from the CD
	\item Read/Write part which is pushed into main memory
\end{itemize}

An image which works partially on disk and partially on RAM
is called a live CD system. The CD-Boot structure of KIWI will
put the directories \textit{/bin, /boot, /lib, /opt, /sbin and /usr}
on the CD and the rest into the main memory of the system.

\subsection{How do you setup an image as live CD}
To create an .iso image which can be burned on CD you only need
to specify the boot image which should handle your live system.
This is done by setting the \textbf{type} of the image in the
\textbf{config.xml} file as follows:

\begin{Command}{9cm}
<preferences>\\
\hspace*{1cm}<type>iso:name</type>\\
\hspace*{1cm}...\\
</preferences>
\end{Command}

The parameter \textbf{name} refers to the CD boot image which
must exist in \textit{/usr/share/kiwi/image}. Like for all boot
images the most important point is that the boot image has to
match the operating system image. This means the kernel of the boot-
and operating system image must be the same. If there is no
boot image which matches you need to create your own boot image
description. A good starting point for this is to use an existing
boot image and adapt it to your needs.

\section{How does the boot image work}

 ...
     Create a live filesystem on CD using the iso boot image
     1 split physical extend into two parts:
        part1 -> writable
        part2 -> readonly
     2 Create two ext2 based images from the part extends
     3 Prepare and Create the given iso boot boot image
     4 Setup the CD structure and copy all files
        including the syslinux isolinux data
     5 Create the iso image using isolinux.sh
