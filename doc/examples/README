#==================================
# Preparation
#----------------------------------
Before you start to use any of the examples provided with kiwi
your build system has to have a valid installation source for
the distribution you are about to create an image for

By default all examples will connect to the network to find the
installation source. It depends on your network bandwidth how fast
an image creation process is and in almost all cases it is better
to prepare a local installation source first. If you can make
sure you have a local installation source it's important to change
the path attribute inside of the <repository> element of the
appropriate example to point to your local source directory

This document describes how to create a local SUSE installation
source which is stored below /images/CDs

1) find your SUSE standard installation CDs or the DVD and
   make them available to the build system. Most linux systems
   auto-mount a previosly inserted media automatically. If this
   is the case you simply can change the directory to the
   auto mounted path below /media. If your system doesn't mount
   the device automatically you can do this with the following
   command:

      mount -o loop /dev/<your-drive-device-name> /mnt

2) You don't have a DVD but a CD set ? No problem all you need to
   do is copy the contents of _all_ CDs into one directory. It's
   absolutly important that you first start with the _last_ CD and
   copy the first CD at last. In case of CDs you should have a
   bundly of 4 CDs. Copy them in the order 4 3 2 1

3) Once you have access to the media copy the contents of the
   CDs / DVD to your hard drive. You need at least 4GB free
   space available. The following is intended to create a SUSE
   11.0 installation source:

      mkdir -p /image/CDs/full-11.0-i386/
      cp -a /mnt/* /image/CDs/full-11.0-i386/

   Remember if you have a CD set start with number 4 first and
   after that unplugg the CD and insert the next one to repeat
   the copy command until all CDs are copied into to /image

Remember to have fun :-)
