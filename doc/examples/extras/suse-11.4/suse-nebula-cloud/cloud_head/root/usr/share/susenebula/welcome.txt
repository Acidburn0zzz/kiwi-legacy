Welcome to SUSENebula

The next few setup steps will guide you through the final configuration of the 
Cloud Head node. After this is complete, your head node is ready for business.

One note on security, this image contains pre-configured ssh keys that are
available (including the private key) to the rest of the world. Therefore it
is recommended that you generate new ssh keys for the oneadmin user. After the
setup steps are complete, login as root (the oneadmin user has no password)
and execute the following command:

ssh-keygen -f /var/lib/one/.ssh/id_rsa

Answer 'y' to over write the existing key. Do NOT enter a passphrase.
