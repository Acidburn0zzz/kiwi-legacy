In order to compile, run
    % qmake 
to create the make file and then run
    % make

qmake should automatically detect your platform.

=== Kiosk mode ===

The imagewriter also has the capability to be used in "kiosks" that may have external harddrives.  In order to compile in code that will
both ignore large hard drives and mark unknown USB sticks as "SUSE Studio", run
    % qmake DEFINES+=KIOSKHACK
to create the make file and then
    % make

in order to start the imagewriter with sudo, do the following:
    % xhost +SI:localuser:root
to allow root access to the current screen and then start the program with:
    % sudo DISPLAY=:0 burner
