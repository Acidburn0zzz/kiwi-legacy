# kiwi xennetboot descriptions
# The boot images here are used in the same way than the netboot
# boot images except that the used kernel is the xen kernel. The
# xen kernel consists of the kernel itself and the hypervisor which
# requires the mboot.c32 loader to be able to load the xen kernel
# directly over the network using the PXE protocol
